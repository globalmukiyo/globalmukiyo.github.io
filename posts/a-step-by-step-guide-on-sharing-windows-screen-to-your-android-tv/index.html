With just a few easy steps, you can transform your living room into a digital entertainment center.\nSo, let’s get started: First, you will need to download a mirroring app for your Windows device. There are many available on the market, but I recommend the “Screen Mirroring” app from Google Play. Once you have downloaded and installed it, you are ready for the next step.\nNow, you will need to connect your Windows device to your Android TV. To do this, open the Screen Mirroring app on your Windows device and click “Connect”. You will be asked to enter a code, which you can find on your Android TV under “Settings”. Enter the code and click “Connect”.\nThe next step is to select which content you want to share. Open the file or application you would like to share and click the “Share” button. You can now select the Android TV from the list of available devices. Once your selection is confirmed, your content will be displayed on the Android TV.\nThat’s all there is to it. Now you can show off your favorite movies, shows, and presentations to your friends and family in the comfort of your own living room. So, what are you waiting for? Try it out now and see for yourself how easy it is to share your Windows screen.\n“In the last few years, the sharing of content and screens between devices has become increasingly attractive and easy to access” - Ray Walsh, Digital Privacy Expert at ProPrivacy.\nAccording to a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), 85% of U.S. adults own at least one type of connected device and 65% own a smart TV.\nAccording to a study from the consumer research firm GfK, the number of streaming devices in the U.S. has grown by nearly 50% since 2016, meaning more and more consumers are embracing the ability to share content across different devices.\n1. Preparation Preparing to share your Windows screens to your Android TV doesn’t have to be difficult. First, ensure that you have a PC running Windows 10 OS and an Android TV. Next, make sure that your PC and Android TV are on the same Wi-Fi network, so that they can communicate. Also, check that your PC and Android TV have the latest updates, and drivers are up-to-date. Finally, you will need a USB cable to connect your Android TV to your PC. When you have these prerequisites in place, you can begin the process of sharing your Windows screen to your Android TV.\n1. Preparation for Sharing Windows Screen on Android TV Technology has made it easier to share our work with others. When it comes to sharing our computer screen, there are numerous ways to go about doing it. One of the easy methods is by using an Android TV and a Windows device. Here are the steps to share Windows screen to Android TV.\nFirst, connect both the Windows device and Android TV to the same Wi-Fi network. On the Windows device, open the Action Center and select the Connect option. Then, select the Android TV name from the list of available devices. Accept permission to connect to the Android TV on both devices.\nSecond, open the Settings app on the Android TV and navigate to Network \u0026 Internet. Then, select the Wi-Fi tab and click on Wi-Fi Details. You will be provided with a randomized IP address and PC name. This should be noted for future use.\nThird, turn on the Project feature on the Windows device. Type Project in the taskbar search box and click on project to this PC.

Sharing Windows Screen on Android TV Sharing your Windows screen directly to Android TV is much easier than most people think. To get started, all you need is the right devices, a few cables, and some preparation. Ensuring the devices are compatible, setting up the cables, and downloading the right app ahead of time are the three key steps to get your screens to mirror each other.\nFirst, check to make sure the device you’re using is compatible with your TV. Many new Windows and Android TVs have a built-in feature that allows you to easily connect them. Then, get the right cables. Most Android TVs use micro-HDMI cables for mirroring, while some Windows use an HDMI to VGA adapter. Some research on the type of cable you need may be required.\nOnce the cables are in place, you’ll need to download the right app. For many Android TVs, the official Android TV app allows you to mirror your Windows screen to the TV. Depending on the type of device you’re using, some alternative apps may be worth exploring.\nFinally, make sure your devices are near each other. To successfully mirror your Windows screen on your Android TV, you’ll need to be in close proximity of the devices. After preparing the devices, cables, and apps, you should be all set to begin mirroring your Windows screen.\n- How to connect Windows PC with Android TV Connecting Windows PC with Android TV is a great way to access and view your content from your laptop or PC on your Android-powered TV.
