But can they connect to an Android phone? The answer is yes, in some limited cases. First, you need to make sure your AirPods have the latest firmware installed. Then you’ll need an app that supports Bluetooth connections from Android phones and AirPods. Once you have this, you should be able to connect the two devices. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible that you may still experience connection issues, and if so, here are a few troubleshooting tips. First, try restarting both the Android phone and AirPods. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you can try connecting them with another device, such as a laptop or tablet. You can also reset the AirPods by pressing and holding the setup button on the AirPods case until the status light begins to flash. Lastly, if all else fails, you can contact Apple Support for help.</p><h3 id=2-resolving-connection-issues>2.
