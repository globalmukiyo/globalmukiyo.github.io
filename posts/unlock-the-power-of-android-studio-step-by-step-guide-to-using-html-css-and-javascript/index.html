Then create a layout file and include the tag <webview>to render the HTML page.</p><p>Once the structure is set up, it is time to start writing the code. HTML code should be written as a template and embedded into the layout. CSS and JavaScript can be written inline with the HTML code or placed in separate files and imported into the layout.</p><p>Next, create a class that extends WebViewClient to customize how the web page interacts with the application. It is important to override onPageFinished() method, which is called when the page has finished loading. In this method, you can add the necessary JavaScript code to control the page.</p><p>Finally, to make the page more interactive, add an instance of a JavaScript interface. This interface can be implemented using the addJavascriptInterface() method. It will enable the JavaScript code to access the Android application, and vice versa.</p><p>By following this step-by-step guide, Android developers can now easily use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Android Studio to create more interactive and engaging applications.</p><h3 id=2-code-implementation>2.
