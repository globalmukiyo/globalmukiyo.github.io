Don’t worry, because there’s still a way to turn on your phone, even without the power button! In this step-by-step guide, learn how to power on your android phone with a broken power button. Today, smartphones are essential for almost everyone’s daily life. Unfortunately, many of us have experienced the setback of having a broken power button. This can be a frustrating and confusing process. But don’t worry, if you have a broken power button on your Android phone, there is still hope! This step-by-step guide will show you how to power on your Android phone even with a broken power button. With a few simple steps, you’ll be ready to start using your phone again in no time. So, let’s get started.\n“Modern Android phones offer users a variety of ways to access their phones without using the power button”, according to Joe Maring, Senior Editor of Android Central. “Using a combination of acessibility features, such as ‘TalkBack’ or ‘Ok Google’, as well as quick settings such as ‘Double Tap to Wake’, users can power on their Android phones without ever having to use the power button.”\nRecent statistics from IDC show that over 81 percent of the smartphone market share is made up of Android phones. With such a large user base, it is important to be aware of the various ways to power on an Android phone with a broken power button.\nEven if you have a broken power button, you can still power on your Android phone by using other methods, such as connecting it to a power source, downloading a power button app, or using wireless charging. With this step-by-step guide, you can easily power on your Android phone even without using the power button.\n1. Method 1: Using Smart Lock Powering on an Android phone with a broken power button can be a difficult ordeal. Luckily, Android has several solutions to this problem. The first one is to use Smart Lock. Smart Lock is a feature that was first added to Android 5.0 Lollipop that allows you to bypass the lock screen if you have a device in close proximity to the phone. To use Smart Lock on Android devices, go to Settings \u003e Security \u003e Smart Lock and set up a secure device or location. Once setup, you simply need to bring your device close to the phone to power it on.\n• Steps of Using Smart Lock Smart Lock is a great way to turn on any android phone with a broken power button. First, you need to activate the Smart Lock feature on your phone. To do this, go to Settings \u003e Security \u003e Smart Lock. After you’ve entered your PIN or pattern, tap Trusted face or Trusted voice to unlock your phone with your face or voice. Once this is done, you’ll be able to use Smart Lock to turn on your phone even with a broken power button. You just need to turn on your phone’s proximity sensor by tapping the power button for a long press, then your face or voice will be recognized and the phone will be unlocked.\n• Troubleshooting Smart Lock Functionality Smart Lock is a feature available on many Android phones that allows you to unlock the device without using the power button. To use it, go to Settings \u003e Security \u0026 Location \u003e Smart Lock and activate the feature. Once it’s enabled, you can turn on the phone just by pushing any button or opening the case. However, you may have to enter your PIN or pattern to unlock the device after that. Additionally, you may need to disable the lock screen before Smart Lock will work. This option is great if you have a broken power button but don’t have access to a charger.\n2. Method 2: Establishing a Wired Connection Establishing a Wired Connection is another method of powering on an android phone with a broken power button. To do so, firstly, you’ll need to use a USB cable to connect your Android smartphone to your laptop. Once connected, your device should be automatically detected and begin charging. Secondly, you’ll need to open your device’s Settings and scroll down to find the ‘Developer Options’. Once there, you’ll need to enable USB Debugging. Lastly, you’ll need to access the device’s bootloader menu by simultaneously pressing and holding multiple keys. Once done, the device will power on and you can access your device as usual.\n1. Setting up a Wired Connection Establishing a wired connection is the second method you can use to turn on an Android phone with a broken power button. To do so, you need a USB cable and OTG adapter. First, connect the OTG adapter to the USB cable and then connect the OTG adapter to the phone. Once it’s connected, press the volume key and the power button at the same time for at least five seconds to turn on the device. Depending on the model, the volume key can be the ‘+’ or the ‘-’ volume key. This method is primarily meant as an emergency backup for when the power button stops working, as it requires you to keep the devices connected if you want to use the phone.\n2. Activating the Phone Without Power Button Establishing a wired connection is an easy and efficient way to turn on an android phone with broken power button. To do this, you will need a compatible USB cable. First, attach the USB cable to your computer. Then, connect the other end of the cable to your phone’s charging port. After making the connection, hold the volume down button and the charging port simultaneously to turn your phone on. Once you have done this, your android phone should be operational. This method of turning on an android phone with broken power button is relatively simple and can be done without relying on the use of a power button.\n3. Method 3: Using a Third-Party App This guide provides three methods to power on an Android phone with a broken power button. The third method involves using a third-party app. There are many apps available to automate the ‘power button’ function on your Android phone. Look for SwitchBot, Power Button to Volume Button, or Gravity Screen apps from the Google Play Store. Download and install the appropriate app for your Android phone, then set it up accordingly. You may need to grant the app the necessary permissions, like access to the device’s settings and Personal information. After you have completed the setup process, the third-party app is now set up to power on your phone. Simply press your device’s volume buttons to turn it on. Finally, check to see if the app is fully functional after powering on your device.\n1. Exploring Third-Party Apps When your power button breaks, you may think that your android phone is a goner, but luckily, there is still a way to turn it on. One way is to use a third-party app that will allow you to turn it on without using the physical button. To do this, you’ll need to download and install the app onto your android phone. After installing the app, you will be able to turn your phone on by pressing a virtual button within the app. This method is great for those who want to turn their phone on without needing to use the physical button.\n2. Turning on Android Phone with a Third-Party App Using a third-party app is the third method you can use to turn on your android phone with a broken power button. The first step is to download and install an app like Power Button to Volume Button from the Google Play Store. After installation, open the app and go through the necessary settings. Most of the apps will include an option to toggle it on or off. Once it is enabled, you will be able to use the volume keys to unlock the phone and power it up. Finally, when the device is on, you can then easily navigate through the menus without the need of the power button.\nQ1 : How do I power on my Android phone with a broken power button?\nA1 : You can power on your Android phone with a broken power button using a USB Type-C or a USB On-The-Go (OTG) cable. Connect one end of the cable to your phone’s charging port and the other end to a power source like a laptop or powerbank. Your phone should turn on automatically after a few seconds.\nQ2: Is there any other way to power on my Android phone with a broken power button?\nA2 : Yes, if you have an NFC tag, you can enable a feature called Android Beam which will allow you to power on your phone when you tap it against the tag. You can find instructions for enabling Android Beam in your phone’s settings.\nQ3 : What is USB On-The-Go (OTG) cable?\nA3 : USB On-The-Go (OTG) cable is a special type of USB cable that can be used to connect two USB devices together. For example, you can use it to connect your Android phone to a computer, or to connect a USB drive or external keyboard to your phone.\nQ4: What types of power sources can I use to power on my Android phone?\nA4 : You can use any of the following power sources to power on your Android phone: a laptop or desktop computer, a powerbank, or a USB wall adapter.\nQ5 : What should I do if my Android phone still won’t power on after connecting it to a power source?\nA5 : If your phone still won’t power on after connecting it to a power source, you may need to perform a factory reset. You can usually find instructions for factory resetting your phone in your device’s manual or in the settings menu.\n","wordCount":"1673","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hugh Kaspar"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://globalmukiyo.github.io/posts/how-to-power-on-an-android-phone-with-a-broken-power-button-a-step-by-step-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Global Mukiyo","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://globalmukiyo.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Global Mukiyo (Alt + H)"><img src=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Global Mukiyo</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://globalmukiyo.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Power On an Android Phone with a Broken Power Button: A Step-By-Step Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1673 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Hugh Kaspar</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-method-1-using-smart-lock>1.
