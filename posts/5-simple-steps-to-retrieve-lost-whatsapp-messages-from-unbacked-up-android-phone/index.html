In this tutorial, we will look at how this is possible even when the phone is not accessible. By following the steps outlined here, users can find their chats from a lost phone.\nPrimarily, one needs to use an emulator to access the lost phone’s WhatsApp. This emulator will replicate the Android system and allow for the retrieval of data.

It is important to note that you should not install the app directly onto the phone, as this could cause further damage.

To do this, go to the Google Drive app on another phone or computer and log in with the same Google account as the one linked to the lost phone. Here, you will be able to recover the backup for your WhatsApp messages.\nYou can also try to retrieve the messages from a local backup on your phone.

To do this, you will need a card reader to download all of the files from the memory card.

Once the files are found, the app will restore them so you can view them on the computer.\nBy following these steps, you should be able to retrieve the messages from a lost Android phone even without backup.
