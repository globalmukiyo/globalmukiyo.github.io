Identifying Multiple Emails for Bulk Deleting Deleting multiple emails at once can be a tedious job, especially when you have to do it from your phone.

Then, tap the three-dot button at the top-right corner and select ‘Select all conversations that match this search’.

Here are some tips on how to do that:</p><p>Firstly, use the checkboxes next to emails to select multiple emails. This should be the go-to method, as it’s the easiest and most accurate.

From there, you can select multiple emails by tapping the checkboxes next to them.</p><p>Finally, selecting multiple emails can also be done using the search function.
