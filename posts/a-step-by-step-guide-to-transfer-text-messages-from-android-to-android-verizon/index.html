Select them, and they should be successfully transferred to the receiver device.</p><p>It is important to note that the recipient device should also have Verizon Message+ installed. Otherwise, the transfer process won&rsquo;t work. In case of any questions or problems, you can always use Verizon&rsquo;s customer support services. With these easy steps, you can now easily transfer text messages from Android to Android Verizon.</p><h3 id=1-download-and-install-the-verizon-content-transfer-app>1.
