A. To factory reset your Android phone without a Google password, you will need to access the device&rsquo;s recovery mode. This mode can be accessed by holding down certain buttons when the device is turned off. Once in recovery mode, you can select the &ldquo;wipe data/factory reset&rdquo; option and confirm the action. After the reset is complete, the device will turn back on without the need for a Google password.</p><p>Q.3 Are there any risks associated with factory resetting my device?
A. Yes, there are certain risks associated with factory resetting your device. The most significant risk is losing important data and files that might not have been backed up.
