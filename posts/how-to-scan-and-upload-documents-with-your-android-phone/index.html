If you have an Android phone, you can use it to scan a document with ease. To make sure you get the most optimal scanning experience, here are some tips you should keep in mind.</p><p>First, make sure your camera lens is clean and dust-free. Dirty camera lenses can reduce the quality of your scans significantly. Additionally, make sure your phone’s camera lens is aimed directly at the document before you start the scan.</p><p>Second, make sure that the lighting in the room is good. Too much or too little lighting can lead to blurry scans.

A shaky hand can result in blurry scans. If you need help, try using a tripod to hold the phone in place while you scan the document.</p><p>Finally, make sure your phone is close enough to the document when scanning. Too far away and you may have to zoom in too much which could result in a lower quality scan.</p><p>By following these tips, you can make sure that you get the most optimal scanning experience with your Android phone.</p><h3 id=2-optimize-your-scanning-settings>2.
